        <section class="hobby"> <b>ELECTRONICS</b></section>
        <span>I have a great interest in electronics projects.The combination of my coding skills and knowledge in electronics have helped me design and develop 
            electronic test fixtures and build home projects. Being fascinated with automation ,I
            figured, python was the most convenient language for automating the test equipments like power supply,
        multimeter and other electronics instruments or devices . Time and serial libraries from python were certainly key tools for electronics 
        projects.</span>
