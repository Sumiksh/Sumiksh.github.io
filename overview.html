        <span>I love doing electronics projects. I use my coding skills along with the electronics knowledge to
        program  electronic test fixtures and build home projects. Being fascinated with automation ,i
            figured out python was the most convenient language for automating the test equipments like power supply,
        multimeter and other electronics instruments or devices . Time and serial libraries from python were certainly very helpful for couple electronics 
        projects.</span>
